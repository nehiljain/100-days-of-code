# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Started setting up the lambda server for brain of my bot.
- Created an endpoint to return true or false if progress log.md (this file) was updated with today's progress.

**Thoughts:** Setup Python3 env, Zappa and basic Flask App. Feels like it took 1.5 hrs to just setup and play with simple github API, need to improve my speed. Refactored logic and simplified requirements in second pass

**Link to work:**

- [API endpoint:=> /brain/api/v1.0/logs/is_updated_today](https://6kvjel14vk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/brain/api/v1.0/logs/is_updated_today)


### Day 2: Jan 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Created webhook for messenger bot to talk to
- Connected messenger bot to api, simple bot set-up

**Thoughts:** Need to spend more time reading fb messenger api. Should not be that hard. Github example repo was super helpful to quickly get things up and running. Will need to refactor brain.py soon.

### Day 3: Jan 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Refactored code, more to go
- Fixed Timezone bug
- Added notification for no progress update

**Thoughts:** Need to start writing tests. Weekends should be heavier than couple 100 lines of push. Push Push Push!!

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet


### Day 4: Jan 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Refactored logging code, more to go
- Bot notifies me if the weather is very cold (feels like < -10) or plesant in winter (feels like > 0)
- New Name, New Logo

**Thoughts:** Need to start writing tests. Push Push Push to write heavier pieces!!

### Day 17: Feb 3, 2018

- Assignment 4 99% complete. Finished making decision trees and calculating error metrics for the same.
- TODO: need to fix a big in spliting the train and validation data for assignment.

**Thoughts:** It was fun to see how I can easily play with Decision Trees and visualise them using graphviz.

**Link to work:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nehiljain/uw_ml.git/master?filepath=classification%2Fweek_3_1.ipynb)


### Day 18: Feb 4, 2018

- Assignment 5 50% complete for building my own decision tree algorithm to get a better understanding.
- Also fixed the splitting of training and val data for assignment 1

**Thoughts:** Visualisation of a making of Decision Tree looks much like KD-Trees. Also implementing simple version of decision tree gives a deeper intuition of what might be happening inside the model and how i can understand a leaf is formed and do feature engineering to change it for lower error

### Day 30: Feb 16, 2018

- Played and understood itertools. It seems to be the missing tools I needed for my data pipeline work. Efficient way to read data without reading it in memory at once and cycling through with multiple times without multiple copies.

**Link to work:** NTS

~~~~~~~~~~~~ Took a 3 Day Break in Provincial Park Algonquin ~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Day 31: Feb 20, 2018

**Link to work:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nehiljain/100-days-of-code/master?filepath=code%2Fdatascience%2FLinearProgramming.ipynb)



### Day 36: Feb 25, 2018

- First LP model completed. Suggests 374 books in 100 hours.


Thougths: ** need to develop better intuition about data cleanup. Could have guessed 0 pages books should be removed. less than 2 star books can be removed. etc. But model works and I have some idea of how to setup objective function and constraints. Need more practice with LP to intuitively create solutions.
